    "In sorting the neighborhoods by popularity of venue types, it became apparent that certain neighborhoods had a concentration of venue types that could better fit certain needs or interests. For instance, the *CN Tower, King and Spadina, Railway Lands, Harbourfront West, Bathurst Quay, South Niagara, Island airport* area had a high frequency of coffee shops, airport lounges, airport service, and airport terminals. For frequent travelers, this would obviously be the most ideal location to stay in. On the other hand, the Rosedale neighborhood was instead dominated by parks, playgrounds, and walking trails which would be a great location for people who like spending time outside in nature.\n",
